Technically this device is useless.. but it's a fun project that probably
costs too much. 

The SRC file will likely be converted into an executable for whatever OS I decide to use. (Probably windows but Ubuntu seems good)

This device is pretty similar to a pipboy but with a lot less use.

Plans so far are, 7 - 10 inch OLED display, micro pc with 8gb ram, 64gb of storage, integrated graphics, and idk what CPU it was.

C-ports for most if not all chargers/cables.

File transfer and secure accounts
Maybe remote connect? For sure cmd access to device plugged in. (using software)

May try to find online features/modules and open source programs that would be useful.
